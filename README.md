# GuessANumberBytheAdventurist
This is a console game, in which Computer chooses a number,
and User have to guess the number with computer's help.
The game is Ð° open source project, with learning purpose.

The entire context:

First step:
Computer chooses a number, that is unknown by the User.

Second step:
User make a guess about the number. 

Third step: 
Two possibilities:

    a. If user guesses the number -> User is winner and game is over.

(The game has additional logic that is in the developing process.)

    b. If user doesn't guess the number -> Game go to next step.

Four step: 

Computer hints the User if the number is less or greater than guess made.
And the steps from two to four are retake until the number is guessed.

The additional logic is:

Complexity the game by increasing levels to 21,
in which the User has to guess 21 different numbers for each of it,
the User is given 8 tries.

If the User doesn't guess the number within 8 tries, he loses the game.

On the other hand, the User goes on to the next level =>  adding levels up to 21.

Adds a total score system in which the User gets points or loses points,
depending on whether they are guessing the number or not => adding score system.

Printing the corresponding messages.
Scoring system: Adds 10 points to the total points for every proper answer => guessed number. Remove 2 points for every wrong answer. And also when the level goes up the user has to choose in a larger interval e.g. on the first level they choose between 1 and 100, on the second level they choose between 1 and 200, and so on.
